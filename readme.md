# My Doctor Project

"My Doctor" is an online healthcare platform where patients can easily book appointments with doctors. By filling out a simple form with their name and email, patients receive a confirmation email for their booking. The platform displays different medical specialties and lists doctors available in each field.

## My Contribution
I was responsible for developing the following pages:

- **Health Tips Page**: This page displays medical tips that users can scroll through. Below the tips, it also shows emergency hospitals in the Mansoura area, including details about their availability and contact information.
  
- **Doctor Profile Page**: This page provides detailed information about each doctor and includes a booking form where patients can schedule an appointment.
